# Croissant Portfolio

> [!TIP]

Hey there, This is my personal portfolio website I designed from scratch

It supports the following sections:
- Name and a short bio
- Education
- Experience
- Projects
- Skills
- Contact Info

Took me a while to build this but I'm open sourcing this for you to be able to use as you wish.

All content is completely editable out of the box from ```me.ts``` file.

## Demo
To checkout this website, go to https://croissant.one

## Installation
To install this website, you need to have nodejs installed on your machine.

1. Clone this repository
2. `cd` into the directory
3. ```npm install``` or ```yarn```
4. ```npm dev``` or ```yarn dev``` to start the development server
5. Checkout the website on http://localhost:3000


## How to use
1. Open the ```src/me.ts``` file
